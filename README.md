# Online-Banking-System
Project Description: Online Banking Management System project is a
comprehensive application that allows users to perform a variety of banking
tasks, including registering and logging in to their accounts, depositing money,
transferring funds between accounts, viewing transaction history, managing
cards, and adding or removing beneficiaries. With an intuitive user interface and
